        <h3>Monetizing Your Channel</h3>
        <p>
            There are several ways to monetize your content on YouTube.
            <ul>
                <li>YouTube Ads</li>
                <li>Sponsorships and Brand Deals</li>
                <li>Crowdfunding</li>
                <li>Selling Merchandise or Digital Products</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            When your channel reaches a minimum threshold of viewers and watch time, your channel will be open to monetization with YouTube Ads. 
            These ads will be placed either before and/or during the video. Keep in mind, that your content needs to follow YouTube's guidelines for being advertiser friendly, or you risk your videos and channel from being demonetized.
            YouTube Ad revenue has been reduced in recent years, so content creators have been prioritizing other methods of monetization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sponsorships are the most common way to monetize your channel. You don't need a million viewers / subscribers to make a decent income. 
            Channels with 10,000 views on their videos is where businesses start to offer channels brand deals.
            
            Brand deals can range in a few hundred to tens of thousands of dollars.
            How much a business offers you for a brand deal varies based on your negotiation skills and the size of your user base.
            Land a handful of brand deals every month, and you can easily make a full-time income.
            
            Negotiate for better offers. Example: If a business offers you $500 for a shoutout, counter-offer with $750 because you know you are worth more. Accept their counter-offer of $600.
            As your negotiation skills improve and your channel grows, you will be able to negotiate for higher offers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the gaming space, the most common brand deals are for Mobile games. Mobile game advertising is heavily scripted, and are intended to get people to download the game and buy microtransactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can choose whether or not to accept any brand deal that is presented to you. But do consider the impact a deal may have on your content, your community, and your morality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Selling physical and digital merchandise will allow fans to directly support you while getting something. The most common goods are clothes and household items.
            Also, you can have your fanbase crowdfund you through a service like Patreon. You can offer exclusive perks to your subscription base, such as early access to content, or exclusive access to other digital goods.
