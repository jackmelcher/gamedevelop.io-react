                    <p>
                        Large AAA and support studios are mainly focused on finding specialized talent to satisfy the business and development needs for a big budget title.
                        Smaller indie and support studios, are looking for talented individuals, employees often act in a more generalized capacity and fulfill multiple roles.
                        Even though you might see companies use the same job title for their job listings, the duties and requirements for the job may vary from studio to studio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recently, more and more studios are starting to operate remotely and globally.
                        So it is entirely feasible for developers to work from home and collaborate online, thanks to all of the tasking and collaboration services available today.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Making Games is a Business and Studios Want Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        Game studios are interested in hiring talented professionals to make a commercial product.
                        The development team’s goal is to make a game that is fun and enjoyable.
                        The business team’s goal is to reach as many customers as possible and to turn a profit from game sales, downloadable content, and/or merchandising.
                        Games often take years to make, so there is always risk when bringing on new people mid-development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Making games is a business, so studios want to minimize risk while maximizing productivity and potential profit.
                        Therefore, a majority of the vacancies in industry are for mid-level and senior-level positions, with far fewer openings for internships or junior-level positions.
                        Studios expect you to be specialized and already have the skills necessary to do the work that needs to be done.
                        They will not hire someone that cannot prove they are competent for a role.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More and more people are studying game development through higher education or as a hobby.
                        Therefore, competition is very high for internships or junior-level openings.
                        For example, the acceptance rate for an internship at Blizzard Entertainment is less than 1%, so you have to make sure your application standout from the rest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you currently do not have skills to fulfill a development or business role, then you can work in entry level roles.
                        These include game testing, customer service, IT desktop support, and various facility roles.

                    <h3>Ways to Apply for a Job</h3>
                    <p>
                        The most straight-forward method of applying is to apply to job opening that is listed on a company's career page.
                        If you are interested at working at a particular studio, but do not see a job opening for a position you would be interested in, then contact an individual at the studio or apply to the general job application.

                        The list of requirements in a job listing is a recruiter's "Unicorn List", all the things the perfect candidate would have.
                        But if you meet at least 50% of the listed requirements on the job description and you feel confident in your abilities, go ahead and apply.
                        Companies still expect to train and onboard new staff, so itis more important that an applicant has the ability to learn.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Ways of Building a Network</h3>
                    <p>
                        Attend local gatherings or mixers.
                        Local gatherings are a great way to meet both hobbiests and professionals in your area.
                        It's also a good way to start building your network if you aren't a professional in the industry yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Attending conventions give industry professionals the opportunity to come together, mingle, and network.
                        At Fan conventions, such as E3 and PAX, industry professionals are present as both attendees and exhibitors.
                        Professionals who are attendees are present to have a good time and casually hangout, so you have the chance to talk with them while you wait in the lines. 
                        While exhibitors are mainly present to market their games, and you might get a chance to talk with the developers during the demo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At professional conventions, such as GDC, they are there to both share their ideas at lectures, and network with other professionals.
                        Networking at professional conventions have a greater likelihood of leading to a business or job opprotunity.

                        With the advent of social platforms, more and more people are establishing their digital networks on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Discord.
