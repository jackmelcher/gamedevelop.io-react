                        Start pitching to publishing partners once you have a Vertical Slice of your game.
                        Focus marketing efforts on making a successful pitch.

                        <b>Multiplayer Alpha and Beta Testing</b> <br>
                        It's very common for multiplayer games to host Alpha and Beta Testing sessions.
                        They can be a good way to let interested players try the game early and share their experience with others.
                        Often times, players will encourage their friends to participate in the betas.
                        People that watch a content creator play the game might also be interested in participating.
                        Successful testing sessions can increase the potential playerbase growth substantially.

                        <b>Go Viral with No Marketing</b> <br>
                        Rarely, games are released with little-to-no marketing and simply go viral because the game is either so good, or so bad, that they want other people to play it.
                        You should not expect your game will succeed on its own.
                        If you want to ensure your game has a successful launch, market it before and after it releases.
