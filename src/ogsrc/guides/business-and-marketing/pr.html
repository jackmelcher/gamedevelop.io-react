                <p>
                    Use Social Media, funnel to a newsletter, forum, or Discord server. Have continued interaction with your community. Go to events, have people playtest your game, and gauge the reaction from your users.
                    Build assets for marketing to give your best first impression.
                    Create a PR Timeline and schedule out your marketing. Set goals for marketing. 
                    Try to write / pitch articles that will make your game or studio standout and get noticed. What is unique about the development team?
                    If your plan is to sell copies, plan a marketing campaign. You have to spend money to make money. A minimum budget for traditional marketing is around $50,000 dollars.

                <p>
                    Have a Call-to-Action that incentivizes.

                <h3>The Importance of Marketing Analytics</h3>
                <p>
                    PR has quantifiable data such as views, clicks, and acquisition. Use analytic tools on Google and social media. They will show how effective your adverts and social media posts are doing. 
                    Use A/B Testing to improve your marketing pages. The goal is to use A/B Testing to reduce the cost of an acquisition and optimize your marketing strategy. Adjust and test against different marketing material to determine which advert will draw more views, clicks, and acquisitions.
                    These are questions you should ask yourself: What is bad about the marketing material? The Header? The Content? The Media? 
                    Another question to ask is: Who is your target demographic? Your data might show that the demographic you are attracting is different than the demographic you were originally targeting. Consider adjusting your marketing accordingly.

                <h3>How to Get Help from News Outlets</h3>
                <p>
                    Easiest way to get News Outlets to help is to prove that your game has the potential for success. Build a relationship with a journalist, then pitch your game to them. Be precise with your PR approach.
                    Show them that your game is launching and has a community.

                <h3>Tips for working with Media Outlets</h3>
                <p>
                    Make a Press Kit. A press kit provides media outlets have all the essential information and images to use in their articles or videos.
                    Give creative freedom to the author or content creator.
                    If you are being interviewed, be honest and say things with 100% certainty. Do not make assumptions about what will be in your game.
                    Avoid using licensed music from the Music Industry in videos/trailers if you don't have an agreement to use it. This could result in a DMCA takedown on the video, a copyright strike on the YouTube Channel, or lawsuit.
