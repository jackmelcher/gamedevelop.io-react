                <h3>How Much Money Do I Ask for?</h3>
                <p>
                    Ask for a reasonable amount of money for your Funding Goal.
                    Strike a balance between the minimum amount needed to start development and the amount needed to fully fund development.

                            If you ask for too much, people may feel that the goal is outrageous. They will be less likely to support the campaign, and it will be more difficult to reach your goal to secure funds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you ask too little, the secured funds may not be enough to actually support development.
